# SIEM_ELK
SIEM Setup and Log Analysis Project

Overview:

This project involves setting up a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to gather, analyze, and monitor security data from various sources. The primary objective is to detect potential threats and generate insights based on log data collected from network and security devices.

Key Objectives:

Configure a SIEM system to ingest log data from multiple sources.
Develop custom alerting rules for detecting security incidents.
Perform log analysis to identify potential threats.
Generate a comprehensive report based on findings from the log analysis.
Technologies & Tools:
SIEM Platform (as per the exercise instructions)
Data Sources: Network logs, System logs, IDS/IPS logs
Log Parsing and Alerting Rules

Steps:
Set Up SIEM:

Follow the setup process for the SIEM platform.
Ensure it is capable of ingesting logs from specified sources (e.g., firewall, endpoint devices).
Ingest Logs:

Configure the system to collect logs from network and security devices.
Ensure log parsing is correctly configured for meaningful data interpretation.
Configure Alerts:

Create alerting rules to trigger notifications for events such as multiple failed login attempts, abnormal network traffic, etc.
Analyze Logs:

Analyze ingested logs to detect patterns and identify potential threats.

Report Findings:

Generate a report summarizing key insights from the log analysis, including any detected incidents and recommendations for mitigation.

Project Deliverables:

SIEM Configuration: Setup details and configuration files.
Log Ingestion Scripts: Scripts or configurations used for automating log ingestion.
Alert Rules: Documentation of custom alert rules configured in the SIEM.
Security Report: A comprehensive report of findings, including recommendations and insights based on the analysis of the logs.
