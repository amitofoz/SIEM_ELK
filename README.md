# SIEM_ELK
SIEM Setup and Log Analysis Project

This project involves setting up a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to collect, analyse and monitor log data from various security sources. The primary objective is to enhance security operations through the configuration of alert rules and event correlation.

Key Features:
Data Ingestion: Configuration of multiple log sources, including network devices, servers, and security appliances, into the SIEM.
Custom Alert Rules: Setup of custom alerting rules to identify potential security threats, such as failed login attempts or network anomalies.
Log Analysis: Investigation and analysis of log data to detect and mitigate security incidents.
Reporting: Generation of a detailed report based on the analysis of ingested logs, highlighting key findings and actionable insights.

Technologies Used:
SIEM Platform (as outlined in the exercise)
Log sources: Network devices, Servers, IDS/IPS

Instructions:
Follow the steps to set up a basic SIEM configuration.
Ingest logs from specified sources.
Create and customize alert rules.
Analyze captured logs for security insights.
Generate a report summarizing the findings.
